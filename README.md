# internetx_autodns
little SDK for https://www.internetx.com/domains/autodns/

to use let´s encrypt it was important for me to change a rr of a zone, so that´s the first thing you can do, other stuff might follow in the future or in case someone pays for it.

the tests are real life, so please setup your credentials in `config/config.ini` (rename the example config).
